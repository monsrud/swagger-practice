This was a learning exercise for me on how to use Swagger to generate an REST API client and service.
It uses swagger-codegen and swagger-ui Docker images. It also runs some simple tests against the service using the autogenerated client. When the build completes, point your browser at the URL below.

Steps to use it are:

- Install Docker on your system and ensure it is functional.
- Run bash build.sh in the toplevel dirctory of the project.

API URL : http://localhost/practice/1.0.0/ui/
